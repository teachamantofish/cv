In-App Help
=======================

DC mobile apps: I designed and hand-coded the help system for Acrobat Reader, Adobe Scan, and Acrobat Sign in 2015. Adobe did not have (and still doesn't have) responsive templates available in their prehistoric doc tools. In 2019, I redesigned the UI and migrated to a markdown-based Python-Sphinx pipeline. These docs garner 5 million page view a year and are localized in 19 languages. They remain the only in-app help systems for any of Adobe's mobile products. 

.. caution:: I handed off the content to a junior writer  in 2021 and there are now a few CSS and layout bugs. I can provide clean doc examples from my personal repo as needed.
