    <p>I'm honest about my capabilities. There's no point in accepting a position in which I cannot excel.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Marketing docs: I've authored many whitepapers and datasheets, but it's a slow slog relative to domain experts. I'm more effective as a reviewer and technical liaison between engineering and marketing teams. </li>
    <li> Coding from scratch: I'm good at regex, batch scripting, templating (jinja, hugo, etc.), HTML, and CSS. But I'm neither an engineer nor a web developer. But hey, I only need to push strings around and create a functional online presence. </li>
    <li> Graphic art: I'm an expert at screenshots, workflow and network diagrams, quick keys, and so on. I'm not a graphic artist and don't use Illustrator, Photoshop, or other raw vector/raster image editing programs. If I need icons, for example, I grab an open source library.</li>
    </ul>
