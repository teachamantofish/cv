Engineers often refer to their core APIs or installable binary as an "SDK". I define an "SDK" in the present context as the sum of the available developer assets. As a **Kit**, an SDK includes all available libraries, docs, tools, demos, and utilities. A usable developer ecosystem requires a comprehensive and well-designed front-end that includes a search engine as well as other bells and whistles.

Acrobat.com
==========================

* https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/
* Status: 2018-2021: Owned and built from scratch all of the PDF Services content, including the publish pipeline. In 2021, I handed this off to engineering. The new developer platform doesn't have a search engine  and other needed bells and whistles which is embarrassing. Since the content organization and style is deteriorating a bit, they've been asking me to fix some issues,  and I recently wrote the PDF Electronic Seal API docs which goes live in October, 2022. 
* Assets: Dev guide, image library, demos, code samples, API reference.

API References
