While engineers often refer to their installable binary as an "SDK", in the context of a developer ecosystem, an "SDK" is the sum of the available developer assets. As a *Kit*, an SDK includes all libraries, docs, tools, demos, and utilities. These developer assets always deserve a comprehensive and well-designed front-end that includes a search engine and other bells and whistles such as navigation, themes, and JS widgets.

A partial list of projects: 

Acrobat Sign
==========================

* Status: In progress. *I inherited 7 year old content*. I've revamped the UI/doc frontend, information architecture, and so on. The content has just started a major overhaul. 
* Assets: New pipeline/format, new UI, dev guide content, REST API, image library, demos, code samples, SDKs (binaries with samples).

PDF viewer
===============================================

* Status: Active. Monthly releases.
* Internal only. Microsoft-Adobe partnership. Adobe's PDF viewer has been integrated into Edge and Teams. These libraries will eventually become public.
* Assets: API Reference, dev guide, release notes, image library, code samples.

Acrobat.com
==========================

* https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/
* Status: 2018-present: Owned and built from scratch all of the PDF Services content, including the publish pipeline. In 2021, I handed this off to engineering. The new developer platform doesn't have a search engine  and other needed bells and whistles which is embarrassing. Since the content organization and style is deteriorating a bit, they've been asking me to fix some issues,  and I recently wrote the PDF Electronic Seal API docs which goes live in October, 2022. 
* Assets: Dev guide, image library, demos, code samples, API reference.

Acrobat SDK
===========================

* Status: I converted 2700 pages of Framemaker docs into markdown and pushed online. The work included removal of 700 pages of duplication, improving the organization and usability, and updating the branding. 
*  *I do not own the 10 year old dev guide content*--I do own the UI/doc frontend, information architecture, and so on). 
* Assets: New pipeline/format, new UI, dev guide content, image library, demos, code samples, updated API references scheduled for 2023.
