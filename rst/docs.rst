SDKs Portals
=================

Engineers often refer to their core APIs or installable binary as an "SDK". I define an "SDK" in the present context as the sum of the available developer assets. As a **Kit**, an SDK includes all available libraries, docs, tools, demos, and utilities. A usable developer ecosystem requires a comprehensive and well-designed front-end that includes a search engine as well as other bells and whistles.

API References
=============================

.. note:: API references are trivial. All SDKs include an API reference. I can use any tool and customize any output. The only work I don't do is Open Web/Swagger server setup as that's integrated with the code and belongs with the engineering team (though I can beautify and brand the UI).


Developer Guides
======================

Forthcoming. For now, see the SDK docs.

User Guides
====================

* DC mobile apps: I designed and hand-coded the mobile app help system around 2015 because Adobe did not have responsive templates available in their prehistoric doc tools. In 2020, I redesigned the UI and migrated to a Python-Sphinx pipeline. These docs garner 5 million page view a year and are localized in 19 languages. They remain the only in-app help systems for any of Adobe's mobile products. I handed off the content to a junior writer last year but continue to manage the UI.

* `Acrobat digital signatures <https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSigDC/index.html>`_. This content is old but continues as the primary digsig resource. 
* 20+ other in product, context sensitive help systems for 4 companies.

Example diagrams
========================

My tool-du-jour is Lucidchart. Images are collaborative and a single online source updates instantaneously in any number of locations.
