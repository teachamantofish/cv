Engineering Work
******************************************************

A few examples . . . 


Doc strategy (proposed to engineering)
============================================

* 2019: My presentation to management arguing for a GIT/text-based collaborative authoring system which could scale.
* Assets: New pipeline/format, new UI, dev guide content, REST API updates, image library, demos, code samples.

Why use text/GIT workflows? 
=============================================

A proposal for the Director of Helpx. 

Rationale:

* Boost productivity up to 500%
* Scriptable
* Native OS features 
* Free and open source tools

   How-to for content managers


Bugs
=========================

As user interface and string experts, writers should file bugs. Writers who truly understand a product can help drive product development by participating in the engineering process. Product expertise is a baseline requirement.

User interface & string work
======================================

* Design live HTML mockups and proposals: 
  
  * iReader: `Mobile and desktop UI mockup 2016  <./demo/iReader/index.html>`_ (**Check out the live Acrobat mobile app!**)
  * Product features search: `Proposal to help users find Acrobat tools (2016) <./demo/findme/index.html>`_
  * Super tips: `2017: A better in-product help experience <./demo/SuperTips/start.html>`_

* Continuously provide usability feedback and file enhancement bugs
* Edited 2000 UI strings over the course of Acrobat's last 15 years 
* Authored most of Acrobat and Reader's security-related strings from 2009-2018

Internal Specifications
=====================================

* FTPDF language and API specification (Liquid Mode in Acrobat)
* Security: Yellow Message Bar Specification
* Adobe Cross Domain Policy Specification
* Registry preference implementation specification for engineering
