              <h3 class="accordionheading">What areas are not my strong suit?</h3>

I'm honest about my capabilities. There's no point in accepting a position in which I cannot excel.

* **Marketing docs**: I've written many whitepapers, but it's a slow slog relative to domain experts. I'm more effective as a reviewer and technical liaison between engineering and marketing teams. 
* **Coding from scratch**: I'm neither an engineer nor a web developer: but hey, I only need to push strings around. . .
* **Graphic art**: I'm an expert at screenshots, workflow and network diagrams, quick keys, and so on. I'm not a graphic artist and don't use Illustrator, Photoshop, or other raw vector/raster image editing programs. If I need icons, for example, I grab an open source library.

              <h3 class="accordionheading">How do you feel about travel?</h3>

* Like it. Traverse City, Michigan is 2 hours via a direct flight to NY. There are 19 non-stop flights from the local airport.
