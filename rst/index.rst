A doc team's role
================================

Stakeholder communication: My take on how writers should interact with other content stakeholders.

   A writer's relationship to content stakeholders

Doc roadmap for Elwood
===========================

Guidance and direction is awesome, but it's not required. I can rapidly ramp with as little as 4 manager POCs: engineering, product management, marketing management, support. You can set priorities, or the first week could look like this: 

* Triage emergencies
* API references live + skeleton developer portal
* Propose a rough documentation strategy

Performance expectations
----------------------------

* Dev portal skeleton: 1 day to build, 1 day to brand, 3 days for review and updates. Assume continuous evolution.
* API References: 1-2 days to brand; 1 day per 100 API code comment updates. Integrate with dev portal: PDQ.
* Dev Guides: Intro, dev env, system reqs, getting a credential: 2 days; Other topics: highly variable. Integrate with dev portal: instantaneous.
* User interface docs: 

   * New publish methodology, including migrating current content to a scalable method: unknown, but fast. 
   * Pages per day: Could start out at 2-5 per day and ramp to 10/day; however, I haven't seen the product so it's a guess.
   * Note that UI docs are often the easiest to produce, but there are often workflow constraints which impair speed to go-live. 

.. caution:: It doesn't auto-magically happen all at once. Requirement: prioritize.

Typical rough plan
--------------------------

.. note:: Just one possibility of course.

Immediate fixes?
--------------------

API Ref cleanup: Link, brand, edit/expand comments.

              <h3 class="accordionheading">What are your weaknesses?</h3>

* **Marketing docs**: I've written many whitepapers, but it's a slow slog relative to domain experts. I'm more effective as a reviewer and technical liaison between engineering and marketing teams. 
* **Coding from scratch**: I'm not an engineer or web developer, but hey, I only need to push strings around. . .
* **Graphic art**: I'm an expert at screenshots, workflow and network diagrams, quick keys, and so on. I'm not a graphic artist and don't use Illustrator, Photoshop, or other raw vector/raster image editing programs. If I need icons, for example, I grab an open source library.
* **Politics**: I'm marginal at sugar-coating bullshit. I speak my mind. 
* Be clear about your expectations, and I'll be honest about my capabilities. There's no point in accepting a position in which I cannot excel.

              <h3 class="accordionheading">How do you feel about travel?</h3>

* Like it.
* Traverse City, Michigan is 2 hours via a direct flight to NY. 
* I visit Europe once or twice a year as my wife is Hungarian: UK visits are fine.
* Note that I maintained an apartment in San Jose for two years *at my own expense* and paid for 2 out of 3 air tickets per quarter. Adobe provided an office for 8 years, but my primary POCs are in India, Boston, and Seattle, so the ROI diminished over time.
* I actually like showing up at an office--though I will not relocate.
* Remote workers are a double-edged sword. If I was building a writing team, I would start with part time contractors.

              <h3 class="accordionheading">What's your interest level in the job?</h3>

* If I'm confident in my success, high. I'm guessing what Elwood needs: API refs, dev guides, dev portal, UI/app docs, a process and tooling with a plan. Despite having strong coding skills *for a writer*, I'm neither an engineer nor a web developer. 
* I need to know what you're building, who your customers might be, and why you think Elwood will thrive in a world with Aladdin, Bloomberg terminal, TOS, and other mature players.
* There's a crypto-verse shakedown in progress. Could be just starting. What is Elwood's strategy?
