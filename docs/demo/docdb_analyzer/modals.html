            <h3>Release Notes</h3>

            <h4>Known issues</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Some AEM data exported to the CSV is bad. For example: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few of the preview links in this app go to 404 and aren't valid. This is an AEM issue, not an app issue.</li>
                        <li>Many AEM Search fields provide no or bad data. For example, all metric and localization fields are useless. </li>
                        <li>"Internal URL" actually maps to the Preview URL<li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Dynamically create the table title from CSV data.</li>
                <li>Use config params to construct AEM search query; for example, data might not come from /using/ or /adobe-connect. Let the user define the query.</li>

            <p>This app provides tools that leverage standard <a href="https://chl-author.corp.adobe.com/content/aemsearch.html">AEM Search</a> CSV data exported from a workflow package. To add your own data, see these <a href="help.html"> instructions.</a> This app can also analyze live TOC data, and the loaded example uses the Adobe Connect Getting Started Guide, Training Guide, and Event Guide. TOC data collection requires 10 minutes of scripting. Contact <a href="mailto:brogers@adobe.com">brogers@adobe.com</a> for changes, bugs reports, and feature requests.</p>

            <h4>Content management features</h4>
            Actions that are faster here than in AEM:
            <ul>
                <li>Parse and analyze content data to <strong> augment AEM standard CSV data</strong></li>
                <li>Parse and analyze live TOC data <strong>AEM does not provide</strong></li>
                <li>Evaluate directory contents for cruft, age, EOL items</li>
                <li>Evaluate the overall strategy and quality of titles, file names, and links to other guides</li>
                <li>Find file copies and potential duplicates</li>
                <li>Find files that were never published or are unpublished (so you can delete them)</li>
                <li>Identify which files reside in different directories</li>
                <li>Work in your browser with all the live links</li>
                <li>Quickly find and work with the data you need: you'll only print and export what you see</li>
                <li>For TOC data, identify which files are in each guide and evaluate content organization</li>
                <li>When authoring in AEM, click less, copy less, paste less, swear less</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data view features</h4>
            <br>

            <h4>Batch action support</h4>
            <br>
